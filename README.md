# Sephora-Statistical-Learning
Analysis of Sephoraâ€™s product dataset focused on two main goals: identifying brands that offer the best value to consumers and predicting product ratings based on key features.

Using K-means clustering, we grouped brands based on average price and rating into four meaningful clusters: luxury brands, affordable good-value brands, budget brands, and lower-value brands. In the second part, we built a classification model to predict product ratings. Applying PCA helped simplify the data, and Random Forest models were trained both with and without class weights to handle the heavily imbalanced dataset.
